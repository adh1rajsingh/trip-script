# üéâ Invitation System Complete!

## What's New?

Your collaboration feature now supports inviting users who **don't have accounts yet**! When you invite someone:

1. **If they have an account**: They get added as a collaborator immediately (existing functionality)
2. **If they don't have an account**: A unique invitation link is generated that they can use to sign up and automatically get access

## How It Works

### For Existing Users
1. Go to any trip you own
2. Click "Collaborators" tab
3. Click "Invite Collaborator"
4. Enter their email and choose a role
5. They're added instantly! ‚ú®

### For New Users (New!)
1. Go to any trip you own
2. Click "Collaborators" tab
3. Click "Invite Collaborator"
4. Enter their email (even if they don't have an account)
5. A unique invitation link is generated
6. Copy the link and share it with them
7. When they click the link:
   - They'll see a sign-up page
   - After signing up with that email, they're automatically added to the trip
   - They can start collaborating immediately!

## Testing the Feature

### Test 1: Invite an Existing User
```
1. Create a test account (or use an existing one)
2. On a trip you own, invite your other email
3. Verify they can see and edit the trip
```

### Test 2: Invite a New User
```
1. On a trip you own, click "Invite Collaborator"
2. Enter an email that doesn't have an account yet
3. You'll see a popup with:
   - A message: "User doesn't have an account yet"
   - A unique invitation link
   - A "Copy" button
4. Copy the link
5. Open it in an incognito/private window
6. Sign up with the invited email
7. You'll be automatically redirected to the trip!
```

## Database Changes

A new `pending_invitations` table was created with:
- `id`: Primary key
- `email`: Email of the invited user
- `token`: Unique token for the invitation link
- `tripId`: ID of the trip they're invited to
- `role`: Their role (editor/viewer)
- `invitedBy`: Who invited them
- `expiresAt`: When the invitation expires (7 days)
- `createdAt`: When the invitation was sent

## Migration Applied

The database has been updated with:
```bash
‚úì Generated migration: drizzle/0006_amused_captain_stacy.sql
‚úì Applied to database
```

## Updated Files

### New Files
- `/src/app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` - Server component for handling invitations
- `/src/app/invite/[token]/AcceptInviteClient.tsx` - Client component for sign-up UI

### Modified Files
- `/src/app/actions/collaborationActions.ts` - Updated `inviteCollaborator()` and `getCollaborators()`
- `/src/components/InviteCollaboratorModal.tsx` - Shows invitation link for new users
- `/src/db/schema.ts` - Added `pendingInvitations` table

## Security Features

‚úÖ **Token-based authentication** - Each invitation has a unique, cryptographically secure token  
‚úÖ **Email validation** - The invitation email must match the sign-up email  
‚úÖ **Expiration** - Invitations expire after 7 days  
‚úÖ **Single-use** - Once accepted, the invitation is deleted  
‚úÖ **Trip validation** - Checks that the trip still exists  

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Integration**: Add actual email sending (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
2. **Invitation Management**: Allow owners to view/cancel pending invitations
3. **Custom Expiration**: Let users set custom expiration times
4. **Resend Invitations**: Button to resend expired invitations
5. **Notification System**: Notify when invitations are accepted

## Important Note: Pusher Configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **You still need to fix the Pusher cluster configuration!**

Your `.env.local` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=eu
```

But your Pusher app (ID: 2058825) is in a **different cluster**. To fix:

1. Go to https://dashboard.pusher.com
2. Find your app (ID: 2058825)
3. Check the "App Keys" section for the correct cluster
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER` in `.env.local`
5. Restart your dev server

Common clusters: `us2`, `us3`, `eu`, `ap1`, `ap2`, `ap3`, `ap4`

## Questions?

The invitation system is now fully functional! The only remaining issue is the Pusher cluster configuration for real-time updates.

Happy collaborating! üöÄ
